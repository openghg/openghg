# Diagrams

These diagrams were created using [D2](https://d2lang.com/).

## Getting started

First get D2 installed, follow the instructions [provided here](https://d2lang.com/tour/install) or if you're on macOS and have [brew](https://brew.sh/) installed you can do

```console
brew install d2
```

## Create the figures

You can use D2 on the command line to output your diagrams to SVG or a number of other formats.

```console
d2 -w input.d2 out.svg
```

## VSCode plugin

You can use the [VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=terrastruct.d2) for a live preview interface.
