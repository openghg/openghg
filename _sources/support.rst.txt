Help and support
================

We welcome new users and hope that we can make your experience of using
and working with OpenGHG as easy and productive as possible.

We've followed a "tutorial-driven development" model, whereby we write
tutorials for all new functionality that is included. Hopefully that
tutorial has helped you get up and running with OpenGHG.

If not, or you are having other problems, then please feel free to
get in touch with us by
`raising an issue <https://github.com/openghg/openghg/issues>`__
on our public GitHub repo. We will endeavour to respond as quickly
as we can.

We have provided some simple templates that should make it easier for
you to give us the information we need to answer your question efficiently.
If these don't fit, then please feel free to use the miscellaneous
template.

We strive to make the OpenGHG community a welcoming, supportive and
helpful place, so please do make sure you read and follow our
`code of conduct <https://github.com/openghg/openghg/blob/devel/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__
when posting issues or otherwise interacting with anyone in our community.
