============

We welcome all helpful contributions to improving the quality of
OpenGHG. Ways you can help include;

* Finding and fixing documentation bugs and typos
* Creating more tests and adding them to the pytest library in the
  ``tests`` directory
* Porting and testing OpenGHG on different computers
* Writing new features

We accept pull requests to the devel branch and are happy to discuss
ideas via
`GitHub issues on the repo <https://github.com/openghg/openghg/issues>`__.

Before contributing we encourage everyone to
:doc:`complete the tutorial <tutorial/index>`, as this gives a good
grounding in how the model works and how the code is laid out. If you have
any problems running the tutorial then please
`raise and issue <https://github.com/openghg/openghg/issues>`__.

Contributing new code
---------------------

We welcome developers who want to join us to help reduce bugs and add
new functionality. Please bear in mind the following;

* We use `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`__ and take care
  not to cause breaking changes in the public API.

We've :doc:`added features <devsupport>` to ``pack_and_doc`` that we hope
will make it easier to develop new code. Please feel free to
`raise an issue <https://github.com/openghg/openghg/issues>`__ if there
is something else you think would help make development easier.

Finally, we have a :doc:`very detailed developer guide <development>` that
we hope will help you get up to speed with development. We strive to
be a helpful, friendly and welcoming community, so if you have any
questions or anything is not clear then please get in touch with
us by `raising an issue <https://github.com/openghg/openghg/issues>`__.
