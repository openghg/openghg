===================
What's new - v0.2.0
===================

**Release date: 2022-07-19**

With the 0.2.0 release of OpenGHG we can announce the public release of our `OpenGHG Hub <https://hub.openghg.org>`_,
our JupyterHub instance for interacting with OpenGHG in the cloud. Please `contact us <https://www.open>`_ if
you'd like to use the service.

Features
========

- New ``openghg.client`` functions for our cloud platform. Standardisation, searching and retrieval of data is passed to either the local or cloud function call depending on platform setup.

Fixes
=====

- Extra checks added to reading of emissions NetCDF datasets that have a single time value. Previously an error occurred due to performing a ``len`` on an unsized object.

Deprecations
============

- Removal of the ``openghg.client.process`` functions. These have been replaced with ``openghg.client.standardise`` functions.

Documentation
=============

- A split in the tutorials for cloud and local platforms. We've updated all the tutorials to better cover the differences in running OpenGHG with different setups.
