Installation instructions
=========================

The easiest way to install OpenGHG is using pip, first ensure you have a recent version of
Python installed.

Checking your Python installation
=================================

OpenGHG is developed and `tested on Linux and MacOS <https://github.com/openghg/openghg/actions>`__,
support for Windows is planned.

To install OpenGHG, you first need to install Python >= 3.7. To check
if you have Python 3.7 installed type;

.. code-block:: bash

    python -V

This should print out the version number of the Python you have available.
If the version number is ``2.x`` then you must use the ``python3`` command, if this this is the case, try;

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -V

and see if you have a Python 3 that has a version number >= 3.7. If so, please use ``python3`` instead of ``python``.

If you don't have Python >=3.7 installed, then you can install Python either via your package manager if using Linux or 
`Homebrew on MacOS <https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python>`__. An alternative for both platforms is `anaconda <https://anaconda.org>`__.

Installation
============

We highly recommend creating a separate virtual environment for ``openghg``. This ensures the correct versions
of libraries can be installed without making changes to versions of libraries needed for other projects / programs.

Virtual environment - pip
-------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m venv /path/to/env/openghg_env
    # Activate the environment
    source /path/to/end/bin/activate

Virtual environment - conda
---------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -f environment.yml
    # Activate the environment
    conda activate openghg

Clone and install
-----------------

OpenGHG is currently very early in its development process so the only way to install
the library is by cloning the repository and installing manually using pip.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/openghg/openghg.git
   cd openghg
   pip install .
