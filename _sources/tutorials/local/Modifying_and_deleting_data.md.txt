# Modifying and deleting data

+++

Sometimes you might want to modify some metadata after running the data through the standardisation scripts.
After the standardisation process the metadata associated with some data can still be edited. This can save
time if the data standardisation process is quite time consuming. Data can also be deleted from the object store.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from openghg.store import data_handler_lookup
from openghg.tutorial import populate_footprint_inert
```

We'll first add some footprint data to the object store.

```{code-cell} ipython3
populate_footprint_inert()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
result = data_handler_lookup(data_type="footprints", site="TAC", height="100m")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.metadata
```

We want to update the model name so we'll use the ``update_metadata`` method of the ``DataHandler`` object. To do this we need to take the
UUID of the Datasource returned by the ``data_handler_lookup`` function, this is the key of the metadata dictionary.

+++

> **_NOTE:_**  Each time an object is added to the object store it is assigned a unique id using the Python uuid4 function. This means any UUIDs you see in the documentation won't match those created when you run these tutorials.

+++

For the purposes of this tutorial we take the first key from the metadata dictionary. We can do this only because we've checked the dictionary and seen that only one key exists. It also means you can run through this notebook and it should work without you having to modify it. But be careful, if the dictionary contains more than one key, running the cell below might not result in the UUID you want. Each time you want to modify the data **copy and paste** the UUID and **double check** it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
uuid = next(iter(result.metadata))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
updated = {"model": "new_model"}

result.update_metadata(uuid=uuid, to_update=updated)
```

When you run `update_metadata` the internal store of metadata for each `Datasource` is updated. If you want to **really** make sure that the metadata in the object store has been updated you can run `refresh`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.refresh()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
metadata = result.metadata[uuid]
```

And check the model has been changed.

```{code-cell} ipython3
metadata["model"]
```

## Deleting keys

+++

Let's accidentally add too much metadata for the footprint and then delete.

```{code-cell} ipython3
excess_metadata = {"useless_key": "useless_value"}
result.update_metadata(uuid=uuid, to_update=excess_metadata)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.metadata[uuid]["useless_key"]
```

Oh no! We've added some useless metadata, let's remove it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
to_delete = ["useless_key"]
result.update_metadata(uuid=uuid, to_delete=to_delete)
```

And check if the key is in the metadata:

```{code-cell} ipython3
"useless_key" in result.metadata[uuid]
```

# Restore from backup

If you've accidentally pushed some bad metadata you can fix this easily by restoring from backup. Each `DataHandler` object stores a backup of the current metadata each time you run `update_metadata`. Let's add some bad metadata, have a quick look at the backup and then restore it. We'll start with a fresh `DataHandler` object.

```{code-cell} ipython3
result = data_handler_lookup(data_type="footprints", site="TAC", height="100m")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
bad_metadata = {"domain": "neptune"}
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.update_metadata(uuid=uuid, to_update=bad_metadata)
```

Let's check the domain

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.metadata[uuid]["domain"]
```

Using `view_backup` we can check the different versions of metadata we have backed up for each `Datasource`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.view_backup()
```

To restore the metadata to the previous version we use the `restore` function. This takes the UUID of the datasource and optionally a version string. The default for the version string is `"latest"`, which is the version most recently backed up. We'll use the default here.

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.restore(uuid=uuid)
```

Now we can check the domain again

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.metadata[uuid]["domain"]
```

To really make sure we can force a refresh of all the metadata from the object store and the `Datasource`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.refresh()
```

Then check again

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.metadata[uuid]["domain"]
```

## Multiple backups

+++

The `DataHandler` object will store a backup each time you run `update_metadata`. This means you can restore any version of the metadata since you started editing. Do note that the backups, currently, only exist in memory belonging to the `DataHandler` object.

```{code-cell} ipython3
more_metadata = {"time_period": "1m"}
result.update_metadata(uuid=uuid, to_update=more_metadata)
```

We can view a specific metadata backup using the `version` argument. The first version is version 1, here we take a look at the backup made just before we made the update above.

```{code-cell} ipython3
backup_2 = result.view_backup(uuid=uuid, version=2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
backup_2["time_period"]
```

Say we want to keep some of the changes we've made to the metadata but undo the last one we can restore the last backup. To do this we can pass "latest" to the version argument when using `restore`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.restore(uuid=uuid, version="latest")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.metadata[uuid]["time_period"]
```

We're now back to where we want to be.

# Deleting data

+++

To remove data from the object store we use `data_handler_lookup` again

```{code-cell} ipython3
result = data_handler_lookup(data_type="footprints", site="TAC", height="100m")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.metadata
```

Each key of the metadata dictionary is a Datasource UUID. Please make sure that you **double check the UUID** of the Datasource you want to delete, this operation cannot be undone! Also remember to change the UUID below to the one in your version of the metadata.

```{code-cell} ipython3
uuid = "13fd70dd-e549-4b06-afdb-9ed495552eed"
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.delete_datasource(uuid=uuid)
```

To make sure it's gone let's run the search again

```{code-cell} ipython3
result = data_handler_lookup(data_type="footprints", site="TAC", height="100m")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
result.metadata
```

An empty dictionary means no results, the deletion worked.
