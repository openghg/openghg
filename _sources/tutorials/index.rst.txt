These tutorials will get you up and running with OpenGHG so you can process, analyse and query data.
The pages linked to below are created from Jupyter Notebooks that are available in the OpenGHG
repository under ``notebooks/tutorials``.

If you've installed OpenGHG locally the tutorials below are available in the `OpenGHG repository <https://github.com/openghg/openghg>`_
under ``notebooks/tutorials/local``.


These tutorials cover the use of OpenGHG when installed locally. They'll help you get started on
standardising measurement data, searching the object store and exploring the NOAA ObsPack.
