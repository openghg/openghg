===================
What's new - v0.2.1
===================

**Release date: 2022-07-27**

The 0.2.1 release of OpenGHG adds a few new small features but mainly bugfixes to make using the OpenGHG Hub smoother and faster.

Features
========

- Adds improved ``get_obs_surface`` behaviour for cloud usage.
- Added shortcut routing for serverless functions, see ``openghg.cloud.call_function``. This differentiates between running on the hub or the cloud, where cloud is classed as running within a serverless function environment.
- Added new ``running_locally`` function in addition to the ``running_in_cloud`` or ``running_on_hub`` to allower easier checks with the ``openghg.client`` functions.

Fixes
=====

- Fix to metadata storage for different sampling period formats
- Fix to ``SearchResults`` where environment checks were resulting in attemping to access a local object store even though we were in a Hub environment.
