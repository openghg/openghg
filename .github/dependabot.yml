# Dependabot configuration for OpenGHG
# 
# What Dependabot does:
# - Automatically checks for dependency updates across Python packages and GitHub Actions
# - Opens pull requests when newer versions of dependencies are available
# - Helps keep dependencies secure and up-to-date with minimal manual effort
#
# How maintainers should interact with Dependabot PRs:
# 1. Review the PR description and changelog links for the updated dependency
# 2. Check that all CI tests pass (GitHub Actions will run automatically)
# 3. If tests pass: merge the PR to keep dependencies current
# 4. If tests fail: investigate the breaking changes and either:
#    - Fix any compatibility issues in the codebase, or
#    - Add version constraints if the update introduces breaking changes
# 5. Configuration adjustments can be made by editing this file (.github/dependabot.yml)
