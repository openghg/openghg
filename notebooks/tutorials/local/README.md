# Tutorials - local

These tutorials are intended for us with locally installed instances of OpenGHG. We hope they cover
everything you need to get setup and started with OpenGHG, from standardising measurement files to exploring
the NOAA ObsPack.

If you have any questions about any of the tutorials or about OpenGHG in general please come and talk to us our [Gitter community channel](https://gitter.im/openghg). If you find any bugs or errors in the tutorials please report them to [us on GitHub](https://github.com/openghg/openghg/issues/new/choose).
